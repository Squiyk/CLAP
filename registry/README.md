# Script Registry

This directory stores scripts that have been imported into the CLAP Script Repository.

Scripts are managed through the application's Script Repository interface accessible from the Tools menu.

**Note:** Script files in this directory are excluded from version control via .gitignore to prevent accidentally committing user scripts.
